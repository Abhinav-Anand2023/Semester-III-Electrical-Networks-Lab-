Hey Anynomous,
This is the practical values of the experiments that I had done in my 3rd semester in my college on the LTspice application. 


LTspice is a free circuit simulation tool from Analog Devices that allows users to: Design circuits, Probe schematics, Analyze circuit performance, and View waveforms.
